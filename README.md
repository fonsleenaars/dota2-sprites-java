# dota2-sprites-java
Small java project to automatically download the latest Dota2 Hero &amp; Item sprites, and create a CSS file to go with it.

I quickly put this together to use in my own projects, it's a bit messy but the gist of it works, feel free to fork & improve as you see fit!

Import the project into your own IDE, in SpriteCreator enter your own API key ([steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)) and run the project. It will automatically output (if you don't set a command line parameter) to your 'user.home/dota2sprites' folder - which would be C:/Users/<username>/dota2sprites on Windows for example.
